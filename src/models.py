"""Data models for PUMS data.

NOTE: SQLAlchemy ORM models are not currently used.
The application uses file-based data collection (CSV files) instead.
This module is kept as a placeholder for future database integration.

# Database ORM models removed - using file-based collection instead.
# See file_collector.py for the active data collection implementation.
